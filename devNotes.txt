It seems that the isr triggers constantly when connected to the 433 MHz rf-receiver.
The output high-levels from the 433 MHz rf-receiver is probably to low low for the ATtiny MCU.
It needs a simple level shifter.
Optic?


STILL SOME ISSUES - same receivers act differently...
Noise and receiver quality may be a challenge

More investigation needed
